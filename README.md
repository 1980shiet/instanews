<h1>Instanews Project</h1>
This project is based on the New York Times website. On the site there is a clickable sections button where you can scroll down and choose different article sections for example arts or sports.  There are twelve articles to choose from once you choose which section you want to see. When one of the articles is clicked it opens a seperate window to a bigger readable article which I thought was pretty neat. On the mobile size I found that having one article on each columnn line instead of two is better, also two for tablet and three for desktop but thats my opinion.  This project was not too bad but I had some issues with trying to get Javacript and Jquery done properly. However, I learned how to utilize Scss better and nesting things easier as well as breakpoints with mobile, tablet and desktop alittle better but not 100% yet haha.  Also,learning how to use grid here with this project also was very helpful in understanding things alittle easier.

<h2>What was used for this project</h2>
I used HTML, Javascript, Jquery, Sass, Scss, Visual Code Studio, and Gulp.
